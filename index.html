      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>
        <span> Definition:</span><br />
        Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people
        to work on a project simultaneously. It helps track changes in source
        code, facilitates collaboration, and provides a history of
        modifications.Git is like a time-traveling tool for code. It helps
        software developers keep track of changes they make to their code over
        time. If something goes wrong, you can easily go back in time to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Real-world Example: </span><br />Imagine you're working on a group
        project with friends. Instead of passing around copies of the entire
        project folder, you each have your own copy. Git allows you to make
        changes independently on your copy (branch), and when ready, you can
        merge your changes back into the main project (branch).<br />
        Imagine you're writing a story on your computer. Before making big
        changes, you take a snapshot of the current version. If you mess up, you
        can always go back to the snapshot and start again. Git does this for
        code.
      </p>
      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        <span> Definition:</span><br />GitHub is a web-based platform that uses
        Git for version control. It provides a place to host Git repositories,
        making it easy for multiple people to collaborate on projects. GitHub
        also offers features like issue tracking, pull requests, and more.GitHub
        is like a shared online space for your code. It's like having a virtual
        office where multiple people can collaborate on a project. GitHub makes
        it easy for everyone to see the latest changes, work on their own parts,
        and bring everything together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Real-world Example: </span><br />
        Think of GitHub as a virtual office where your project is stored. Each
        team member has their own desk (branch) to work on specific tasks. When
        someone completes their work, they submit a "pull request" to bring
        their changes back to the main project. GitHub acts as the project
        manager, keeping everything organized.<br />Think of GitHub as a virtual
        office where everyone has their desk. Each person works on their part of
        a project without getting in each other's way. When they finish, they
        share their work with the team. GitHub keeps everything organized, like
        a central hub for teamwork.

      <h2>SSH Key Generation</h2>

<p>To establish secure communication between your local machine and GitHub, follow these steps:</p>

<code># Generate a new SSH key using the Ed25519 algorithm</code>
<code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code>
<p>This command creates a new SSH key using the Ed25519 algorithm, enhancing security.</p>

<code># Copy the generated public key to the clipboard</code>
<code>clip &lt; ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>
<p>This command copies the generated public key to the clipboard, ready for pasting into GitHub settings.</p>

<p>Next, go to GitHub settings under SSH, click "Add SSH Key," and paste the generated keys. Finally, check the connection with:</p>
<code># Check if the connection was successful</code>
<code>ssh -T git@github.com</code>
<p>This command verifies if the SSH connection to GitHub is successful, ensuring secure authentication displaying <code>Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.</code></p>
<p> Alernatively we can update the remote URL to use SSH using <code>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git
</code></p>
<p>We can set username and email in local machine through cmd using <code>git config --global user.name and git config --global user.email
</code></p>
